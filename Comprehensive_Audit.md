## 1. MISSING FEATURES (Not Built At All)

### Frontend Pages
| # | Feature | Phase | What's Missing |
|---|---------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Auth middleware.ts | MVP | No Next.js middleware file for auth redirects (unauthenticated → /auth/login, authenticated → /home). AuthGuard component exists as client-side alternative but no server-side middleware |
| 2 | Onboarding step-4 (Master Resume) | MVP | Page file exists but step-4 = MasterResumeStep not verified as spec-complete |
| 3 | Onboarding step-5 (AI Keys) | MVP | Page file exists but step-5 = AIKeysStep not verified as spec-complete |
| 4 | /status public page | MVP | Page exists at /app/status/page.tsx — needs verification of service health display |

### Backend Endpoints
| # | Feature | Phase | What's Missing |
|---|---------|-------|----------------|
| 5 | GET /content/templates | MVP | Endpoint not implemented — no resume template listing |
| 6 | GET /applications/:id/timeline | MVP | Application timeline sub-route not implemented |
| 7 | POST /applications (create) | MVP | No direct create endpoint — applications only created via submit flow |

### Backend Services
| # | Feature | Phase | What's Missing |
|---|---------|-------|----------------|
| 8 | Application duplicate guard | MVP | No check for max 2 applications per company per 90 days |
| 9 | Application daily limit | MVP | No daily application limit enforcement per user/profile |
| 10 | Copilot /stats command | MVP | Not routed in execute_action() |
| 11 | Copilot /compare command | V2 | Not routed — side-by-side job comparison |
| 12 | Copilot /help command | MVP | Not routed — list available commands |
| 13 | AI usage stats tracking | MVP | get_usage_stats() returns empty data — no aggregation table or logic |

### Celery Tasks
| # | Feature | Phase | What's Missing |
|---|---------|-------|----------------|
| 14 | Playwright ATS auto-fill | MVP | application_tasks.py just marks as submitted — no browser automation |
| 15 | LinkedIn recruiter discovery | V2 | outreach_tasks.py returns stub "requires LinkedIn integration" |
| 16 | Gmail OAuth integration | V2 | email_tasks.py returns stub "requires Gmail OAuth" |
| 17 | Email scanning/detection | V2 | No rejection/interview pattern matching from emails |
| 18 | Email sending via SMTP | V2 | No SMTP configuration or sending logic |

### Infrastructure
| # | Feature | Phase | What's Missing |
|---|---------|-------|----------------|
| 19 | Terraform IaC | MVP | No infra/terraform/ directory — no EC2, security groups, IAM, ECR, S3 state backend |
| 20 | GitHub Actions CI/CD | MVP | No .github/workflows/ directory in either repo |
| 21 | Frontend vitest.config.ts | MVP | No unit test configuration for frontend |
| 22 | Frontend playwright.config.ts | MVP | No E2E test configuration for frontend |
| 23 | Frontend tailwind.config.ts | MVP | Implicit via @tailwindcss/postcss v4 — no explicit config file for custom colors/tokens |

## 2. INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATIONS (Partially Built)

| # | File Path | What Exists | What's Missing |
|---|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | `backend/app/api/v1/jobs.py` GET / | Cursor pagination with 4 filters (status, min_score, company, profile_id) | Spec requires 15+ filter params: location_type, seniority, employment_type, salary_min, salary_max, skills, decision, date_range, source, bookmarked, etc. |
| 2 | `backend/app/api/v1/applications.py` GET / | Basic list with status/profile_id filter | Cursor pagination stub returns `has_more: False` always — not properly paginated |
| 3 | `backend/app/api/v1/notifications.py` GET / | Basic list with priority/unread filter | Cursor pagination stub returns `has_more: False` always |
| 4 | `backend/app/api/v1/notifications.py` mark-all-read | Implemented as `PUT /read-all` | Spec requires `POST /mark-all-read` |
| 5 | `backend/app/services/copilot_service.py` | chat_stream, list/delete conversations, execute_action (3 actions) | Missing /stats, /compare, /help slash commands; missing proactive_suggestions function |
| 6 | `backend/app/services/content_service.py` | Full 2-variant generation, QA, quality scoring | Content not actually uploaded to R2 — only r2_key assigned, no upload logic |
| 7 | `backend/app/services/ai_proxy_service.py` | Full provider routing, BYOK, circuit breaker | get_usage_stats() returns zeros — no real tracking |
| 8 | `frontend/lib/realtimeManager.ts` | Singleton class with table subscriptions | Not auto-initialized in auth flow — `realtimeManager.initialize(userId)` never called |
| 9 | `frontend/app/loading.tsx` | Root-level loading state | No per-route loading.tsx files for sub-routes |

---

## 3. STUB/PLACEHOLDER CODE

| # | File Path | Line(s) | What It Says | What It Should Do |
|---|-----------|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | `backend/app/tasks/email_tasks.py` | ~L10-15 | `scan_inbox()` returns "Email scanning requires Gmail OAuth" | Implement Gmail OAuth token refresh, IMAP/API inbox scan, rejection/interview pattern matching |
| 2 | `backend/app/tasks/email_tasks.py` | ~L20-25 | `send_email()` returns "Email sending requires SMTP" | Implement SMTP connection, template rendering, email dispatch |
| 3 | `backend/app/tasks/outreach_tasks.py` | ~L10-15 | `discover_contacts()` returns "Contact discovery requires LinkedIn integration" | Implement LinkedIn profile scraping via Playwright |
| 4 | `backend/app/tasks/application_tasks.py` | ~L30-40 | Comment: "Actual Playwright ATS submission is a future feature" | Full Playwright ATS auto-fill: detect ATS type, fill fields, upload resume, capture screenshot, submit |

---

## 4. ARCHITECTURE / WIRING BUGS

| # | Issue | Severity | Details |
|---|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Review route ordering bug | HIGH | In `backend/app/api/v1/review.py`, `POST /bulk-approve` is defined AFTER `/{item_id}` routes. FastAPI will match "bulk-approve" as an item_id UUID, causing a 422 validation error. Must move `/bulk-approve` before `/{item_id}` routes. |
| 2 | Supabase Realtime not initialized | MEDIUM | `realtimeManager.ts` exists but `initialize(userId)` is never called in the auth flow. Realtime subscriptions are never established. |
| 3 | Settings AI key location mismatch | LOW | Spec says AI keys at `/settings/ai-keys` but implemented at `/ai/keys`. Frontend already uses `/ai/keys` so this is an architectural divergence, not a bug. |
| 4 | Notifications mark-all-read wrong method | LOW | Implemented as `PUT /read-all` but spec requires `POST /mark-all-read`. Frontend may use wrong method. |

---

## 5. DATABASE GAPS

| # | Table | Gap | Type |
|---|-------|-----|------|
| 1 | `education` | Missing column `relevant_coursework` (Text or JSONB) | Missing Column |
| 2 | All tables | No Supabase RLS (Row-Level Security) policies created | Missing Security |
| 3 | `jobs` | `search_vector` TSVECTOR column exists with GIN index but no trigger to auto-populate it on INSERT/UPDATE | Missing Trigger |

**Note:** 19/20 tables are complete with all required columns, types, relationships, indexes, and mixins. The only column gap is `relevant_coursework` on the education table.

---

## 6. API CONTRACT VIOLATIONS

| # | Endpoint | Issue |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | `GET /api/v1/applications` | Pagination stub — always returns `next_cursor: null, has_more: false` regardless of result count |
| 2 | `GET /api/v1/notifications` | Same pagination stub issue |
| 3 | `GET /api/v1/jobs` | Only 4 filters exposed (status, min_score, company, profile_id). Spec requires 15+ including: location_type, seniority, employment_type, salary_min, salary_max, skills, decision, date_from, date_to, source, bookmarked |
| 4 | `GET /content/templates` | Endpoint missing entirely — 404 |
| 5 | `GET /applications/:id/timeline` | Endpoint missing entirely — 404 |
| 6 | `PUT /notifications/read-all` | Should be `POST /mark-all-read` per spec |

---

## 7. UI/UX DEFECTS

| # | Issue | Severity |
|---|-------|----------|
| 1 | No per-route loading.tsx files — sub-routes show blank during data fetch | MEDIUM |
| 2 | No frontend middleware.ts for server-side auth redirects (relies on client-side AuthGuard) | LOW |
| 3 | Realtime not wired — score badge updates, kanban changes, notifications won't auto-refresh | HIGH |
| 4 | Missing feature components not verified: DiffViewer, PDFViewer, RichTextEditor (Tiptap), FileUploader drag-drop, CompanyLogo (Clearbit), UndoToast countdown | MEDIUM |
| 5 | D3 Sankey diagram for analytics funnel not verified as implemented | MEDIUM |
| 6 | @dnd-kit Kanban board in /applications — drag-drop not verified as functional | MEDIUM |
| 7 | @tanstack/react-virtual for Job Browser (2000+ items) — virtualization not verified | MEDIUM |

---

## 8. TESTING GAPS

| # | Issue |
|---|-------|
| 1 | No frontend unit tests at all — no vitest/jest configuration, no test files |
| 2 | No frontend E2E tests — no playwright configuration, no test files |
| 3 | Backend coverage threshold set to 45% in pyproject.toml — spec requires 60% |
| 4 | Backend has 170 tests passing (good), but missing tests for: outreach service, email service, copilot service, file service, market service, notification service |
| 5 | No E2E test for critical user journeys: signup → onboarding → discovery → scoring → review → apply |

---

## 9. SECURITY ISSUES

| # | Issue | Severity |
|---|-------|----------|
| 1 | No Supabase RLS policies created on any table | HIGH |
| 2 | CORS configuration allows configurable origins via env var — verify production restricts to Vercel domain only | MEDIUM |
| 3 | No input sanitization verified (DOMPurify frontend / bleach backend) for user-generated content | MEDIUM |
| 4 | next.config.mjs has `ignoreBuildErrors: true` — TypeScript errors suppressed in production builds | MEDIUM |
| 5 | `search_vector` TSVECTOR has no parameterized query guard — verify no SQL injection via search endpoint | LOW |

---

## 10. INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Terraform IaC (EC2, SG, IAM, ECR, S3 state) | MISSING |
| 2 | GitHub Actions: ci-backend.yml | MISSING |
| 3 | GitHub Actions: ci-frontend.yml | MISSING |
| 4 | GitHub Actions: deploy-staging.yml | MISSING |
| 5 | GitHub Actions: deploy-production.yml | MISSING |
| 6 | GitHub Actions: e2e-nightly.yml | MISSING |
| 7 | Frontend vitest.config.ts | MISSING |
| 8 | Frontend playwright.config.ts | MISSING |
| 9 | Frontend .env.example | MINIMAL — only 4 variables documented |
| 10 | next.config.mjs | MINIMAL — missing image domains, env exposure |
